I'm Francisco: a Software Engineer based in Porto, Portugal.

In 2019, I graduated from Engineering Physics at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon.

Altough I have not studied computer science, programming is one of my passions. I am mainly into 
C++ and Python.

I am self-taught in security topics and passionate about internet of things. Currently, I work for
Anchorage Digital as Software Engineer. I write C++ code that runs on Hardware Security Modules
(HSMs) and implements the operations needed to support custody, staking and governance for a wide
variety of cryptoassets.

On a non-professional level, I am also a Scout Leader. I am a supporter of non-formal education,
which allowed me to develop my communication and leadership skills due to my involvement in NGOs.
